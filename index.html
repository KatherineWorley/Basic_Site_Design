                <h1>Katherine Worley</h1>
                <h2>Marketing/Creative/Developer</h2>
                <p>A Chicago native, or more accurately from the home of Ovaltine USA and Portillo's Restaurants: Villa Park, Ill. Farther, my family were Slovakian immigrants who arrived at Ellis Island determined to succeed in this new land of opportunity.</p>

                <p>In my first job as a professional designer for a large pharmaceutical company, I learned that design is the cornerstone of good communication. Although my responsibilities were limited to in-house graphic design and creating direct mail materials, this experience was great training and an important step towards design, budgeting, and management.</p>

                <p>In my next position, I learned the fundamentals of press production and different types of forward printing. This is an industry that’s reinvented itself in astonishing leaps and bounds, becoming “greener” and more cost-effective within a few short years.</p>

                <p>Moving to the financial sector, first within an accounting firm and on to work for a national financial institution, I managed creative projects and programs in a variety of media. My deviation towards UI/UX design and automation within a digital, reporting and financial function have become my focus. Striving to frame financial data in an orderly, simple and effective manner to drive stronger decision-making.</p> 

                <p>As industries develop and grow in new directions, I’ll continue learning new ways to design my view of the world and myself.</p>

            <h3>Flagler College</h3>
            <p>Bachelor of Arts - BA, Graphic Design/Advertising</p>
            
            <p>Flagler College is a private four-year liberal arts college in St. Augustine, Florida, United States. It was founded in 1968 and offers 29 majors and 34 minors. The college has been named by U.S. News/World Report as one of the "Best Regional Colleges in the South" (ranks #2 in 2018 and 2017) and in The Princeton Review "Best 380 Colleges." Its its acceptance rate averages 40% of its annual applications. The college had an endowment of over $60 million as of April 2011. [Wikipedia.com]</p>

            <p>The college is named for Henry Morrison Flagler, a Gilded Age industrialist, railroad pioneer and entrepreneur who partnered with John D. Rockefeller to found the Standard Oil Company.</p>

            <p>In 1888, Flagler built the Hotel Ponce de León, his first in a series of luxury resorts along Florida’s east coast. A masterpiece of Spanish Renaissance architecture and the first major poured-in-place concrete building in the United States is now known as Ponce de Leon Hall. A National Historic Landmark, it serves as the centerpiece for Flagler College.</p>

            <p>The grand hotel launched the careers of young architects John Carrére and Thomas Hastings who are noted most for the New York Public Library and The House and Senate Office Buildings adjacent to the Capitol in Washington, D.C.  Interestingly, Carrére and Hastings, were young men right out of college when they designed the hotel.</p>

            <p>The Edison Electric Company powered the building with steam heat and 4,000 electric lights, making the Ponce one of the nation’s first electrified buildings. Louis Comfort Tiffany is credited with the building’s interior design including the stained glass and mosaics. [Flagler.edu]</p>
